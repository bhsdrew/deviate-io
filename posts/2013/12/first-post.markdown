So one weekend I decided to learn Ruby and make a blogging engine. Meet Deviate my ruby self deploying blogging engine.

Here is a Markdown link to [Warped](http://warpedvisions.org), and a literal. 

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, and `code()`. Note that underscores in 
words are ignored in Markdown Extra.
<pre><code data-language="javascript">

// Markdown extra adds un-indented code blocks too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}
</code></pre>
