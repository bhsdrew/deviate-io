Oh hey there I didn't see you. This is my first post.

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one 
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.  

Here is a Markdown link to [Warped](http://warpedvisions.org), and a literal. 

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, and `code()`. Note that underscores in 
words are ignored in Markdown Extra.
<pre><code data-language="javascript">

// Markdown extra adds un-indented code blocks too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}
</code></pre>
